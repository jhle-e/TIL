### Q1. What is an Amazon VPC?

- **Virtual Private Cloud**
- Virtual Public Cloud
- Virtual Public Compute
- Virtual Private Cloud

> Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS

### Q2. An AWS VPC is a component of which group of AWS services?

- Global Infrastructure
- Database Services
- **Networking Services**
- Compute Service

> A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to a single AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud, providing compute resources with security and robust networking functionality.

### Q3. What does an AWS Region consist of?

- **A distinct location within a geographic area designed to provide high availability to a specific geography.**
- A console that gives you a quick, global picture of your cloud computing environment.
- A collection of databases that can only be accessed from a specific geographic region.
- A collection of data centers that is spread evenly around a specific continent.

> Each region is a separate geographic area. Each region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones.

### Q4. Which statement best describes Availability Zones? 

- A Content Distribution Network used to distribute content to users.
- Restricted areas designed specifically for the creation of Virtual Private Clouds.
- Two zones containing compute resources that are designed to automatically maintain synchronized copies of each other's data.
- **Distinct locations from within an AWS region that are engineered to be isolated from failures.**

> An Availability Zone (AZ) is a distinct location within an AWS Region. Each Region comprises at least two AZs.

### Q5. What is an AWS region?

- A region is an independent data center, located in different countries around the globe.
- **A region is a geographical area divided into Availability Zones. Each region contains at least two Availability Zones.**
- A region is a collection of Edge Locations available in specific countries.
- A region is a subset of AWS technologies. For example, the Compute region consists of EC2, ECS, Lambda, etc.

> A region is a geographical area divided into Availability Zones. Each region contains at least two Availability Zones.

### Q6. Which of the following is correct?

- **\# of Edge Locations > # of Availability Zones > # of Regions**
- \# of Availability Zones > # of Edge Locations > # of Regions
- \# of Availability Zones > # of Regions > # of Edge Locations
- \# of Regions > # of Availability Zones > # of Edge Locations

> The number of Edge Locations is greater than the number of Availability Zones, which is greater than the number of Regions.

### Q7. In which of the following is CloudFront content cached?

- Availability Zone
- Region
- **Edge Location**
- Data Center

> CloudFront content is cached in Edge Locations.
